# Mission Planning and Scheduling System

## Overview
The Mission Planning and Scheduling System is a comprehensive software solution designed for planning and managing space missions. It encompasses various tasks such as payload integration, launch vehicle selection, orbital trajectory planning, rendezvous and docking maneuvers, and mission timeline management. The system is developed to ensure flexibility to accommodate dynamic changes and contingencies during mission execution.

## Features
- **Payload Integration**: Manage the integration of payloads into spacecraft or launch vehicles.
- **Launch Vehicle Selection**: Select appropriate launch vehicles based on mission requirements, payload mass, and destination.
- **Orbital Trajectory Planning**: Calculate optimal trajectories for spacecraft based on mission objectives, orbital mechanics, and target destinations.
- **Rendezvous and Docking Maneuvers**: Plan and execute rendezvous and docking operations with space stations, satellites, or other spacecraft.
- **Mission Timeline Management**: Create and manage mission timelines, including pre-launch activities, in-orbit operations, and post-mission procedures.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Handle dynamic changes and contingencies during mission execution, such as mission delays, trajectory adjustments, and resource constraints.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C, Python

## Usage
1. Launch the Mission Planning and Scheduling System application.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various mission planning and scheduling tasks.
3. Input mission parameters, payload details, and other relevant information as requested.
4. Review and analyze mission plans, trajectories, and timelines generated by the system.
5. Make adjustments and modifications as necessary to accommodate changes or contingencies.
6. Save mission plans and schedules for future reference or sharing with team members.
